# WeaponsLocker!
This app is designed with the vision of keeping track of your personal firearms, attachments, and even ammunition. 
The inspiration behind this MVC came from personal experience with having "too much". This application not only helps keep track of the inventory you have but also helps you keep track of maintenance.
Another use for this app would be to share some of the firearms/attachments/ammo you personally own with others. Instead of having to break it down for them, they can log in and see it for themselves.
Code Language: C#, HTML, JavaScript
